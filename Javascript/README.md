Carts
---

In the first file [Carts.js](./Carts.js) I have made a function that fetches ten carts from a API and let them display them on the website with javascript. This is done with a for loop and in this loop the elementen are created.

Then you have also 2 button one of the is a toggle function that shows all the cards an let them disappear.

The other button shows a random cart. This is done with the random function in javascript. If the random cart has been chosen than all the other cards get a classname with hidden so they disappear.

This is a function that I used in my portfolio to loop through my projects.
The function has a const with the data but this const can also be a fetch.

In this loop is a foreach used so it goes per project and with the .innerhtml en .src functions the are placed in the HTML.
