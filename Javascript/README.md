Carts
---

In the first file [Carts.js](./Carts.js) I made a function that fetches ten carts from a API and let them display on the website with javascript. This is done with a 'for loop' and in this loop the elements are created.

Then you also have 2 buttons, one of them is a toggle function that shows all the cards and let them disappear.

The other button shows a random cart. This is done with the random function in javascript. If the random cart has been chosen, all the other cards get a classname with th name "hidden" so they disappear.

This is a function I used in my portfolio to loop through my projects.
The function has a const with the data but this const can also be a fetch.

In this loop is a foreach used so it goes per project and with the .innerhtml en .src functions these are placed in the HTML.
