# Fair-Trade-Software-CMS

The CMS is the backend for the webshop. This shows all the orders and the clients.

### button
This is a file for the button component. I have made changes to the button according to the design so it is more user-friendly.

### draggable
On the CMS you can make your own pages. On every page, there is a text field you can drag and drop. It is possible to make new pages. I was responsible for the looks of the new page so I made the LogoModule for the logos that are on the page.

### Orders
In the orderView there is a table with a summary of all the orders. I made this page and if you click on the order you go to the detail page of that order.


The Fair Trade Software Webshop is a big project where a lot of developers have worked on. I played a big part in this project.
