# Fair-Trade-Software-CMS

The CMS is the backend for the webshop here you can see all the orders and the clients.

### button

This is a file for the button component. 
I have made a few changes to the button so it is according to design and is more user-friendly.

### draggable

On the CMS you can make your own pages and on every page, there is a text field you could drag and drop. If you made a page I was responsible for the looks of the new page so I made the LogoModule for the logos that are on the page.

### Orders

In the orderView we have a table with a summary of all the orders. I made this page and if you click on the order you go to the detail page of that order.
