Gulp
===

This is a Gulpfile that I used to compile my Sass files to CSS and compress my javascript file to load them more quickly in the website so the website is faster.

This gulpfile is version 4.0.0 and with this version the `gulp.parallel` and the `gulp.series` function these function where added in the 4.0 version of gulp.

These function helps you with managing tasks and ordering the tasks if you execute the default task of gulp.
